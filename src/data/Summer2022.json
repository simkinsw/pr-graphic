With the title of Chicago’s best on his shoulders, Skerzy has been making his mark at regionals, majors and locals this year, telling everyone who’ll listen that Chicago ain’t free. Skerzo could have used travel as an excuse to avoid in-region events, but he did not. He attended 21 PR-eligible events this season, second to only Eggy among this season’s PR.",
            "Out of region, these wins have been numerous. Skerzo has turned a new leaf in his rivalry with Drephen. He finished in top 8 at The Function 2, undoubtedly the most stacked regional of 2022, taking out Zuppy in the process. He took out the UK’s finest In Professor Pro and Frenzy in a dominant showing at Moky’s Dojo X Pit Smash. He won a smattering of regionals, like BOPME and CT GamerCon.",
            "In region, Skerzo’s position has evolved. While Michael and he were regulars in the grand finals of Midlane and Tripoint events last year, the two did not play once this past spring. Instead, the hooded fox shabo has become his rival. Shabo held a slim 3-2 lead on Skerzo this past season. On the other hand, Smashdaddy’s stay in Chicago was dominant over Skerzo, who failed to take a single set off of the Socal standard bearer."

            "Skerzo’s 2022 has been most notable in his out-of-region performances. With the title of Chicago’s best on his shoulders, Skerzy has been making his mark at regionals, majors and locals this year, telling everyone who’ll listen that Chicago ain’t free. Skerzo could have used travel as an excuse to avoid in-region events, but he did not. He attended 21 PR-eligible events this season, second to only Eggy among this season’s PR.",
            "Out of region, these wins have been numerous. Skerzo has turned a new leaf in his rivalry with Drephen. He finished in top 8 at The Function 2, undoubtedly the most stacked regional of 2022, taking out Zuppy in the process. He took out the UK’s finest In Professor Pro and Frenzy in a dominant showing at Moky’s Dojo X Pit Smash. He won a smattering of regionals, like BOPME and CT GamerCon.",
            "In region, Skerzo’s position has evolved. While Michael and he were regulars in the grand finals of Midlane and Tripoint events last year, the two did not play once this past spring. Instead, the hooded fox shabo has become his rival. Shabo held a slim 3-2 lead on Skerzo this past season. On the other hand, Smashdaddy’s stay in Chicago was dominant over Skerzo, who failed to take a single set off of the Socal standard bearer."
